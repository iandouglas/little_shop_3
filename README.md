# README

This is group project for the Turing School of Software and Design's Backend
Engineering Program, Module 2 class.  The group consists of:

Earl Stephens 34906415+earl-stephens@users.noreply.github.com
Jennica Stiehl <25069483+stiehlrod@users.noreply.github.com>
Julia Marco <35079289+juliamarco@users.noreply.github.com>
Trevor Nodland <42710030+tnodland@users.noreply.github.com>

The project is meant to simulate an e-commerce site.  It will make use of our
classroom learning on topics such as CRUD, RESTful routes, database setup and access,
ActiveRecord, authentication and authorization, Ruby on Rails, nested resources
and namespacing, and TDD.  

The project will be hosted on Heroku.com, with a URL of:

https://intense-cove-81501.herokuapp.com/

Ruby on Rails version 5.1.6 was used to create this project.  Postgresql version
11.1 was used for the project.

The database creation was done after all of the user stories were examined by
the group and decisions were made about topics such as the number of tables
required and what data should be included in each table.  A visual representation
of the schema was then created, which is shown below.  Once the schema was agreed
upon, the database was created.
